# <font color="#B00000">Sharing SLEEPY Simulations</font>

Part of the goal with writing SLEEPY in Python is to make it easy to share your simulations online. We offer one easy route to doing this here. 

1. Prepare your simulations in a Jupyter Notebook. This can be done locally, but can also be done online, for example, in [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com). 

2. Add `!github clone https://github.com/alsinmr/SLEEPY/` to the first line of the notebook to add SLEEPY so that SLEEPY is downloaded to Google Colab when run online

3. Upload your Jupyter Notebook to a public [GitHub](http://github.com/) repository.

4. Navigate to the notebook on the Github repository. Copy the web address. Change "github" in the address to "githubtocolab" in the address. For example:

[https://githubtocolab.com/alsinmr/SLEEPY_tutorial/blob/main/ColabNotebooks/Chapter1/Ch1_basics.ipynb](https://githubtocolab.com/alsinmr/SLEEPY_tutorial/blob/main/ColabNotebooks/Chapter1/Ch1_basics.ipynb)

More generally:
`https://githubtocolab.com/<username>/<repository>/blob/<branch>/<path_to_notebook>/<notebook.ipynb>`
