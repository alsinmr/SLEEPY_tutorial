# Relax with SLEEPY!

Spins in Liouville space for rElaxation and Exchange in PYthon (SLEEPY) is software for simulating primarily NMR experiments (with some EPR capabilities) under dynamic conditions (exchange) and with relaxation processes. It is a complete simulation package, allowing arbitrary pulse sequences for solution and solid-state (static and spinning) simulations. A fully objected-oriented implementation makes interactive coding and execution easy.  SLEEPY is developed in Python, allowing easy integration with the broad range of Python modules, including the core scientific libraries Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib libraries. SLEEPY is also easily run online using [Google Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/alsinmr/SLEEPY_tutorial/blob/main/ColabTemplate.ipynb)
