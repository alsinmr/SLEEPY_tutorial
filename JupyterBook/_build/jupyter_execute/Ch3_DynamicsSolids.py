# SLEEPY was originally developed for simulating relaxation in solids. For good reason: relaxation is orientation dependent in solids, so that the orientationally-averaged rate constants that may more easily calculated are not always sufficient to analyze the multi-exponential relaxation behavior observed in solids. Slow (Î¼s-ms) reorientational motion that is masked in solution NMR is also present in solids and plays an important role in behavior of various experiments. We investigate some of these processes as well as other application of SLEEPY in solid-state NMR.
