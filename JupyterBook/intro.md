# Relax with SLEEPY!

Spins in Liouville space for rElaxation and Exchange in PYthon (SLEEPY) is software for simulating primarily NMR experiments (with some EPR capabilities) under dynamic conditions (exchange) and with relaxation processes. It is a complete simulation package, allowing arbitrary pulse sequences for solution and solid-state (static and spinning) simulations. A fully objected-oriented implementation makes interactive coding and execution easy.  SLEEPY is developed in Python, allowing integration with the broad range of Python modules, including the core scientific libraries Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. SLEEPY can also be run online using [Google Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/alsinmr/SLEEPY_tutorial/blob/main/ColabTemplate.ipynb), where all simulations in this tutorial can be executed in Colab using the link at the top of each page.
