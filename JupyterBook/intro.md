# Relax with SLEEPY!

Spins in Liouville space for rElaxation and Exchange in PYthon (SLEEPY) is software for simulating primarily NMR experiments (with some EPR capabilities) under conditions including dynamics (exchange) and relaxation processes. SLEEPY is developed in Python, allowing easy integration with the broad range of Python modules, and including the core Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib libraries. SLEEPY is also easily run online using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
