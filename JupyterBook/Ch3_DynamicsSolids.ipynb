    "SLEEPY was originally developed for simulating relaxation in solids. For good reason: relaxation is orientation dependent in solids, so that the orientationally-averaged rate constants that may more easily calculated are not always sufficient to understand more complex processes occuring in solids. Slow (Î¼s-ms) reorientational motion that is masked in solution NMR is present in solids and plays an important role in behavior of various experiments. Text \n",
