Fast-relaxing electrons can have a variety of effects on NMR spectra. First, the relaxation of the electron acts a stochastic field on the nuclei, inducing paramagnetic relaxation enhancement. Second, while electron relaxation removes splittings on the nucleus resulting from hyperfine couplings, the electronic $\alpha$ and $\beta$ states are not equally populated, so that the nuclear resonance frequency shifts. This is known as the contact (isotropic hyperfine) and pseudo-contact (dipolar hyperfine) shift. We show how to simulate these effects here.
