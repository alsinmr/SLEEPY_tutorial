If you have simulations you'd like to include here, please [get in touch](https://biophysik.medizin.uni-leipzig.de/research/dr-albert-a-smith-penzel/). Try to have clean code and explanations about what you're simulating. Webpages are built based on Jupyter Notebooks, so if you can prepare your code using Jupyter Notebooks, it will make it easier to add to the SLEEPY tutorial. Feel free to ask us for help!
