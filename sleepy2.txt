Quadrupolar phenomena (no colab check yet)
	Last sentence of the introduction: "a deuterium nuclei"
	[5] figsize
	Second order quad... broadening... You have "most simulation packages" twice in the same sentence
	[7] The saved image of the plot have overlapping axis label with axis, I guess tight_layout() would solve it
	
DNP
Solid Effect
	It bothers me that the title is "Solid Effect" and in the text you write "solid-effect"... :D
	Source [2] first, Numbering, second... ****
	[5] missing function parenthesis
	You suddenly start talking about trityl, I didn't see that introduced before? Sounds like a topic jump
	[6]2.0031 is the g-value of the trityl?
	[12] in the explaination after the plot, you miss a space after comma
	Dependence on relaxatio times: "difference" -> different?
	[14] give the user a note that the calculation might take a while, also, 
	[15]put a _ before ax.legend
	[17] put _ before ax legend
	Now you write "Solid-Effect" 

Cross-Effect
	[5] put _ before ax.set_xlabel()
	Cross-effect events...
	You put Thurber source in here again
	[8] The presaved figure was now upside down here, maybe this will
	[11] put _
	[14] put _
	after [15] you say "cross effect" in the text
	
Overhauser Effect
	Here you write Trityl capital. Change it here or in Solid Effect
	Source [2] The name is Slichter, not Schlichter
	Not sure about the rules there, but you write 'non-secular' and 'pseudosecular' in one sentence, should this be uniform with or without -?
	[4,6,7,9,10?,11,14] missing _
	[13] running gives me a different result than the stored one (-89.5 vs -92.0)
	
	
NOVEL
	General: In the titles of the other sections you capitalize a lot of words, but not here
	Build the system... can you write the pi/2 pulse nicer?
	[3,4,6,8] mising _
	after [7,12] can you write 5*T1 with latex? (cdot)
	same for the title "Use longer relaxation delay..."
	
Paramagnetic Effects
	Second sentence... acts as stochastic field?
	
PRE
	Fourth sentence, T1 and T2 the nuclear T1 and T2... somethings missing here
	Last sentence before [6] *differnce*
	[20] There was a warning preshown but the run doesnt provide it
	[22] same here
	
Contact shift
	your link "pseudocontact shift" leads to "Pseudo-Contact Shift"
	[6] add _
	you use both high-temperature and high temperature approximation
	
Pseudo-Contact Shift
	yeah, update wheather you want to use - or not
	You also use Pake pattern & pake-pattern
