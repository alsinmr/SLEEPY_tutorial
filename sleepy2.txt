Quadrupolar phenomena (no colab check yet)
x	Last sentence of the introduction: "a deuterium nuclei"
x	[5] figsize
x	Second order quad... broadening... You have "most simulation packages" twice in the same sentence
x	[7] The saved image of the plot have overlapping axis label with axis, I guess tight_layout() would solve it
	
DNP
Solid Effect
x	It bothers me that the title is "Solid Effect" and in the text you write "solid-effect"... :D
x	Source [2] first, Numbering, second... ****
?	[5] missing function parenthesis
x	You suddenly start talking about trityl, I didn't see that introduced before? Sounds like a topic jump
x	[6]2.0031 is the g-value of the trityl?
x	[12] in the explaination after the plot, you miss a space after comma
x	Dependence on relaxatio times: "difference" -> different?
ok	[14] give the user a note that the calculation might take a while, also, 
x	[15]put a _ before ax.legend
x	[17] put _ before ax legend
x	Now you write "Solid-Effect" 

Cross-Effect
x	[5] put _ before ax.set_xlabel()
?	Cross-effect events...
x	You put Thurber source in here again
ok	[8] The presaved figure was now upside down here, maybe this will
	[11] put _
	[14] put _
	after [15] you say "cross effect" in the text
	
Overhauser Effect
x	Here you write Trityl capital. Change it here or in Solid Effect
x	Source [2] The name is Slichter, not Schlichter
x	Not sure about the rules there, but you write 'non-secular' and 'pseudosecular' in one sentence, should this be uniform with or without -?
x	[4,6,7,9,10?,11,14] missing _
ok	[13] running gives me a different result than the stored one (-89.5 vs -92.0)
	
	
NOVEL
x	General: In the titles of the other sections you capitalize a lot of words, but not here
x	Build the system... can you write the pi/2 pulse nicer?
x	[3,4,6,8] mising _
x	after [7,12] can you write 5*T1 with latex? (cdot)
x	same for the title "Use longer relaxation delay..."
	
Paramagnetic Effects
x	Second sentence... acts as stochastic field?
	
PRE
x	Fourth sentence, T1 and T2 the nuclear T1 and T2... somethings missing here
x	Last sentence before [6] *differnce*
x	[20] There was a warning preshown but the run doesnt provide it
x	[22] same here
	
Contact shift
x	your link "pseudocontact shift" leads to "Pseudo-Contact Shift"
x	[6] add _
x	you use both high-temperature and high temperature approximation
	
Pseudo-Contact Shift
x	yeah, update wheather you want to use - or not
x	You also use Pake pattern & pake-pattern
