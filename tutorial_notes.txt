Gerneral hints
- you randomly use rf, RF or radiofrequency
- you sometimes but text that refers to code in a box with background to highlight it, but its very inconsistent I think. I dont always know when you refer to code or an object or a class...
- What I would really like is if functions/classes would be highlighted in some specific color in the text that you always know exactly what it is refering to
- often you set the figsize at the end of the script, while you could do it with
  plt.subplots(figsize=(), sharex=True, sharey=True)
- for ExpSys().set_inter() I am disturbed that you always calculate the euler angles on the fly. Cant you make a setter for euler that calculates it if the angle is an integer or smth?

Relax with sleepy
X- the sentence before the last one sounds a little like you include sleepy into numpy



Gettting Started
x- "placed with*in* other python modules..."
x- delete "required modules must..."  redundant
x- Recommended Installation*s*


A Quick start
 Example 13CR1p
  - "... we then*n* build a L...*,*"
X- L.kex -> make a setter funciton for that?
X  - [6] figsize
ok  - [9] DetProp is a function? make it lowercase. No
  

Short examples
 x - [3] please use keyword vOH in ExpSys()
 ok - [8] I would not really call it a oneliner :D
        however, could one find a better keyword for i?
        
Objects
 X - why not use OOP as abbreviation?
 X - (uh) "black-box" ??? 
  
Experimental Settings
Ok  [3] can you implement a angle setter which will accept "MAS" as keyword?
	MAS is the default. We wouldn't normally set this. Just as example
X  [7] remove axis ticks?
x  [10]v  ex.rotor_angle: *R*otor angle
  
  
Hamiltonians & Liouvillians
? Source [1] ***
X  [15] the keyword Thermal might be lowercase
 
Propagators & Sequences
X   [5]v Âµs one is in latex the others are normal text?
   
Exchange in 1D-Spectra
X  [10]&[11] figsize
  
EXSY
X   Last Script "plotting" does not work for me
   
Block-McConell
X   Ref [1] Link to wrong paper
X   [7-10] figsize..
   
CEST
X   [4] dont you have to set Thermal=True somewhere?
    
T1&NOE
?    Overhauser Reference ***
Ok    also the referencing seems not to have continuous numbering, its all 1
    
TROSY
X   Wrong abbreaviation capitals
X   [3] put delta in ex.set_inter... its confusing this way
    Reference numbering! and *** formatting
    
R1p
   [4] put _ before the last plot
   [13]time is not defined, I am not sure if you intendet to still have the time check there. Also, it takes ages. Please warn the user ( 5 minutes to reach -7)
   [14]&[16] put _ before ax.set_ylabel

REDOR
   [14] set size inches
   - *fulling averaged coupling*
   
DIPSHIFT
   Too often the word decoupling in the description
   "...sufficienty slow motions..."
   Didnt capitalize the acronym
   Source [1] too much stars
   [8] &[15] figsize
   
RECRR
   in the pulse formula, there are different 'minus'-signs
   - "Build the propagators and density matrices." you never ended title with a dot before
   [9] put _  before RECRR.plot()
   [11] remove axis labeling from the not first/last col/row
   
   
T1NOE
   [4][6] add _
   
DARR
   Idk, the other topics you do directly head with the acronym but not in this case?
   PDSD there is a space too much
   [5][7] _ _ _
   
   
Quadrupolar phenomena (no colab check yet)
