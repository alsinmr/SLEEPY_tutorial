	[10] add _

Experimental Settings and Spin.System Definition

Liouvillian
	Source [1] Second Author is Zimmermann not man, double n! test me if you can
	
Density Matrix
	[10] add _
	
Exchange in 1D
	[6] add _
	
EXSY
	[6] you set sm=None and 2 lines later sm=0
	[9] & [10] you create a I=list() but you never use it
	
BMRD
	[11]&[12] Is there a reason to use dark colors for plotting? with dark background they are just not good visible
	
CEST
	[9] figsize
	
T1 limits
	[2] why not put clone pyDR in the first code block of colab?
	[6] add _
	[10] add _
	[9] & [13] the plots look different for me when I run the code, idk if its numerical issue that creates noise in a different way for me?
	
TROSY
	Source [2] the *** problem
	
SolidStateNMR
R1p Relaxation
	Um, you wrote relaxation lowercase here, bevore you wrote it uppercase in titles at least
	Source [2] you misspelled Lewandowski
	[7] the presaved plot is missing in the notebook
	
REDOR
	Source [5] you misspelled Levante
	[7] did you intend to keep the time printout there? however it seems to take ages in calculation for me (you took obv 23 seconds, i take 126, I wonder why that is, but maybe you had still some cache from multiple running?
	[12] seems like the notebook is not properly updated? there was a printout of Axes even though there was a _, idk
	
DIPSHIFT
	in the very end you write dipshift lowercase

DARR
	do you keep the references that way?
	after S.Clogh you put a dot instead of a comma
	
	
DNP
Solid Effect
	you still have 'solid-effect' in the text
	
NOVEL
	Source [1] it makes W.Th. a link in the website. guess it just needs a space
	Build the system.... second sentence. make pi a greek letter?
	[8] the axis label of the right plot is overlapping on the left plot
	
PRE
	[21] The stored output shows a warning about unphysical system, but the colab output does not
	[23] same here
	
Contact shift
	[5] overlapping axis label
	[7] B0 does not have a setter function oh no...
	
Pseudo-Contact shift
	[14] the z-axis label is cutoff, guess tight_layout solves it
	
Relaxation Options
	[5] & [10] & [15] & [18] [21]23,25,27,29,31 missing _
